# üìò Incremental Regularized Least Squares (iRLS)

This project implements an **incremental version** of the Regularized Least Squares (RLS, or ridge regression) algorithm.

Instead of solving the RLS problem from scratch using the entire dataset, we construct the optimal solution **incrementally**, using **one sample at a time**.

## üßÆ Objective Function

We aim to solve:

$$
\min_{w,b} \sum_{i=1}^m (w^\top x_i + b - y_i)^2 + \lambda \|w\|_2^2 + \epsilon b^2
$$


This is a generalization of **Least Squares** (LS), where LS is equivalent to RLS with \( lambda = 0 \), \( epsilon = 0 \).

## üöÄ Incremental Algorithm Strategy

Instead of recomputing the entire solution every time a new training sample is added, we **update the existing solution**:

### Steps:

1. **Start with 1 sample**: Solve the RLS problem for the first data point.
2. **Add samples one-by-one**: For each new training point \( (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) \), update the existing solution \( \tilde{w}_n \to \tilde{w}_{n+1} \) without recomputing from scratch.
3. **Track covariance matrix \( C \)**: Maintain and update matrix \( C = X^\top X + \lambda I \), where \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \) is the matrix of input samples.

## üîÅ Matrix Update via Sherman-Morrison Formula

To efficiently update the inverse of the covariance matrix:

Let:
- \( C_n = X_n^\top X_n + \lambda I \)
- \( C_{n+1} = C_n + x_{n+1} x_{n+1}^\top \)

We use the **Sherman-Morrison formula** to compute:

$$
(C_n + u v^\top)^{-1} = C_n^{-1} - \frac{C_n^{-1} u v^\top C_n^{-1}}{1 + v^\top C_n^{-1} u}
$$

Set \( u = v = x_{n+1} \) to compute \( C_{n+1}^{-1} \) from \( C_n^{-1} \), which enables us to **incrementally update** the solution.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of iRLS

- Efficient for **online learning** and **streaming data**
- Avoids recomputing full matrix inverse
- Naturally scales with data arrival
